# LinkedIn Post Generator System Design

## System Overview

The LinkedIn Post Generator is a feature within the LinkedIn Automation Platform that allows users to generate, edit, and schedule LinkedIn posts based on article links and topics. The system streamlines the content creation process by automatically generating post variations that users can customize.

## Authentication and User Management

The system integrates with Supabase for secure user authentication and data storage:

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - **Sign Up**: Multi-step form collecting account, company, and goal information
   - **Sign In**: Email/password authentication with session management
     - Utilizes `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` client-side for `signInWithPassword`.
     - Client-side authentication state is managed via `SupabaseProvider` context.
   - **Password Reset**: Secure password recovery flow
   - **Session Management**: Handled via cookies set by `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`.
   - **Route Protection**: Middleware checks session cookies and manages access to protected routes.

2. **Security Measures**
   - Server-side session validation via middleware using `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` (`createMiddlewareClient`).
   - Password hashing and security managed by Supabase Auth
   - Protected API routes with RLS (Row Level Security)
   - CSRF protection handled implicitly by Supabase Auth Helpers cookie mechanism (verify this if critical).

3. **User Profiles**
   - Core user data stored in auth.users table
   - Extended profile information in public.user_profiles table
   - Goal tracking and preference management (as per user profile schema)
   - Company and website information storage

4. **Database Schema for Authentication**
   - **auth.users**: Core authentication information (managed by Supabase)
   - **public.user_profiles**: Extended user information
     - full_name: User's full name
     - company_name: User's company
     - website: Company website
     - goals: Array of selected marketing goals

## Component Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Dashboard (src/app/dashboard/page.tsx)**
   - Main application interface
   - Displays scheduled and posted content
   - Contains developer controls and feature toggles
   - Uses `useSupabase` hook for auth state and `signOut`.
   - Includes client-side check to redirect unauthenticated users.
   - Integrates with the PostGenerator component
   - Includes the `ProfileButton` component in its header/navigation area.
   - Post management functionality:
     - `handlePost`: Schedules individual posts and updates their status
     - `handlePostAll`: Batch schedules all pending posts
     - `handleEditPost`: Loads a post into the editor for modification
     - `handleDeletePost`: Removes posts from the system
     - `handleSaveCurrentPost`: Saves newly created/edited posts to the database

2. **PostGenerator (src/components/PostGenerator.tsx)**
   - Form for industry, topic selection, article selection, and post generation triggering.
   - Displays generated post variations
   - Provides navigation, editing (manual & AI), and version history for posts.
   - Allows saving posts to the dashboard via `onSavePost` prop.

3. **Authentication Components**
   - **Login (src/app/login/page.tsx)**: User authentication
     - Uses `useSupabase` hook to access context-provided client for login actions.
   - **Signup (src/app/signup/page.tsx)**: New user registration
   - **ResetPassword (src/app/reset-password/page.tsx)**: Password recovery
   - **SupabaseProvider (src/components/providers/supabase-provider.tsx)**: Authentication state management
     - Creates single client instance (`createClientComponentClient`) and provides it via context.
     - Provides `user`, `session`, `isLoading`, `signOut`, and the `supabase` client instance.
     - Handles `onAuthStateChange` events.

4. **ProfileButton (src/components/ProfileButton.tsx)**
   - Displays user avatar or default icon in the dashboard header.
   - Fetches the user's `avatar_url`.
   - On click, opens the `ProfileModal`.

5. **ProfileModal (src/components/ProfileModal.tsx)**
   - A modal dialog containing a form for users to view and edit their profile information (Full Name, Industry, Job Title).
   - Allows users to upload/update their profile photo.
   - Interacts with Supabase `user_profiles` table to fetch/save data and Supabase Storage for avatars.

6. **UI Components**
   - ChevronIcons (src/components/icons/ChevronIcons.tsx): Navigation arrows for post cycling
   - Future components: Modal dialogs, Toast notifications, etc.

### Data Models

1. **Post**
   - id: string
   - title: string
   - content: string
   - imageUrl?: string
   - scheduledDate: string
   - scheduledTime: string
   - status: 'scheduled' | 'posted' | 'failed'
   - engagement?: { likes: number, comments: number, shares: number }

2. **Topic**
   - id: string
   - label: string

3. **UserProfile (public.user_profiles)**
   - id: uuid (from auth.users)
   - email: string
   - full_name: string
   - company_name: string
   - website: string
   - goals: string[]
   - industry: string (nullable)
   - job_title: string (nullable)
   - avatar_url: string (nullable) - Public URL of the profile photo in Supabase Storage.
   - created_at: timestamp
   - updated_at: timestamp

### State Management

1. **Authentication State**
   - Managed by `SupabaseProvider` using React Context.
   - User session information
   - Login status tracking
   - User profile data access

2. **Dashboard State**
   - activeTab: Controls which tab is currently visible
   - postingStates: Tracks the posting status of individual posts
   - showScheduleButtons: Toggles visibility of scheduling features

3. **PostGenerator State (Managed within the component)**
   - Form State: articleLink, selectedTopic, customTopic, isCustomTopic, isGenerating11

### Authentication Flow

1. **Sign Up Process**
   - User submits multi-step form with account, company, and goal information
   - Supabase Auth creates user in auth.users
   - Database trigger creates entry in public.user_profiles
   - User receives confirmation email
   - Upon confirmation, user can log in

2. **Sign In Process**
   - User submits credentials on Login page.
   - `handleLogin` uses `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword` from `useSupabase` hook.
   - `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` handles setting session cookies upon successful login.
   - `SupabaseProvider` detects `SIGNED_IN` event via `onAuthStateChange` and updates context.
   - Client-side navigation (e.g., `router.push('/home')`) occurs.

3. **Protected Route Access**
   - User navigates to `/dashboard`.
   - `middleware.ts` intercepts the request.
   - Middleware uses `createMiddlewareClient` to check for session cookies.
   - If no session cookie, middleware **rewrites** the response to serve the `/login` page content (URL remains `/dashboard`).
   - If session cookie exists, middleware allows the request to proceed.
   - `Dashboard` component renders, uses `useSupabase` hook to get auth state.
   - If `user` is null after loading, it performs a client-side redirect to `/login` (redundant safety check).

### Post Management Flow

1. **Post Scheduling Flow**
   - Individual Post Scheduling:
     - User clicks the schedule button next to a post in the dashboard
     - `handlePost` method is triggered with the post ID as a parameter
     - UI shows a loading spinner within the post button during the process
     - Simulated API call is made to the LinkedIn posting service
     - On success, the post status is updated from 'scheduled' to 'posted'
     - On failure, the post status is changed to 'failed'
     - Post status visual indicator updates in real-time
   
   - Batch Post Scheduling:
     - User clicks "Schedule All" button in the dashboard sidebar
     - `handlePostAll` method processes all posts with 'scheduled' status
     - Posts are processed sequentially with individual loading states
     - Status updates are applied to each post upon completion
     - User sees real-time feedback as each post is processed

2. **Post Editing Flow**
   - User clicks "Edit" on a post card in the dashboard
   - `handleEditPost` method loads the post content into the post editor
     - Sets the current post state with title, content, and image URL
     - Scrolls the editor into view with smooth animation
     - Shows a temporary notification confirming editing mode
   - User makes changes to the post content or title
   - Textarea automatically resizes to fit content as user types
   - User can leverage AI editing feature for assistance
   - User clicks "Post" to save changes
   - `handleSaveCurrentPost` sends updated post to the server
   - Updated post appears in the posts list with success notification

3. **Post Deletion Flow**
   - User clicks "Delete" on a post card
   - `handleDeletePost` method shows a browser confirmation dialog
   - If user confirms deletion:
     - API request is sent to delete the post from the database
     - Post is immediately removed from the UI for a responsive experience
     - If the API call fails, an error message is displayed
   - If user cancels, no action is taken

4. **Post Creation and Saving Flow**
   - User creates a new post via editor or uses AI-generated content
   - User clicks "Post" button to save the content
   - `handleSaveCurrentPost` method prepares post data:
     - Adds current date/time for scheduling
     - Sets initial 'scheduled' status
     - Includes title, content, and optional image URL
   - Post data is sent to the server via API
   - On success:
     - New post is added to the display posts list
     - Success notification is briefly shown
     - Editor is cleared for new content
   - On failure:
     - Error message is displayed
     - User can retry the save operation

### Profile Management Flow

1. User clicks the `ProfileButton` in the dashboard header.
2. The `ProfileModal` opens (state managed by the `Dashboard` component).
3. `ProfileModal` fetches the current user's data from the `public.user_profiles` table using the user ID obtained from the `useSupabase` hook.
4. Form fields (`full_name`, `industry`, `job_title`) are populated. The current avatar is displayed using `avatar_url`.
5. User edits text fields.
6. User clicks "Upload Photo":
   * A file input (`<input type="file" accept="image/*">`) is triggered.
   * User selects an image. Client-side validation checks file type/size.
   * The file is uploaded to the `avatars` bucket in Supabase Storage using the path `public/{user_id}.{ext}`. The `upload` function should use the `upsert: true` option to replace existing files.
   * Supabase Storage returns the public URL for the uploaded file.
7. User clicks "Save".
8. The `ProfileModal` performs a Supabase `update` on the `public.user_profiles` table for the current `user.id`, setting the new `full_name`, `industry`, `job_title`, and the `avatar_url` obtained from the upload (if a new photo was uploaded).
9. On success, the modal closes, feedback is potentially shown (e.g., toast notification), and the `ProfileButton` (and potentially other UI elements) might refresh to show the new data/avatar.

### Post Generation Flow

1. User enters either a topic or a direct article URL into the main input field of the PostGenerator component.
2. User clicks "Generate Posts" button, triggering the handleGeneratePosts method.
3. handleGeneratePosts determines if the input is a URL or a topic:
   - **If URL:** Makes an API call directly with the URL to fetch, summarize, and generate posts.
   - **If Topic:** Makes an API call with the topic to search for articles, potentially allowing selection (if applicable based on final design), then fetch/summarize the chosen article and generate posts. (Current implementation might simulate parts of this).
4. Generated posts are stored in the generatedPosts state array.
5. First post is automatically selected (currentPostIndex = 0).

### Post Navigation Flow

1. User clicks navigation arrows to cycle through posts
2. handlePreviousPost and handleNextPost methods update currentPostIndex
3. useEffect hook updates editedPost when currentPostIndex changes (if not in editing mode)
4. UI displays the post at the current index

### Post Editing Flow

1. User clicks the edit button on a post, triggering handleStartEditing
2. isEditing state is set to true, displaying the editing interface
3. User edits the post content in the textarea
4. User can save changes (handleSaveEdit) or cancel (handleCancelEdit)
5. If saved, the post at the current index in generatedPosts is updated and added to the edit history
6. User can undo changes by clicking the undo button, which reverts to the previous version from history
7. User can redo changes by clicking the redo button, which applies a previously undone edit

### AI Post Editing Flow

1. User clicks the AI edit lightning bolt icon in the post header
2. An animated panel slides open within the post container
3. User enters an edit instruction in the AI Edit text field
4. User clicks the AI edit button, triggering the handleAiEdit method
5. handleAiEdit makes an API call to OpenAI with the current post text and edit instruction
6. The API returns an edited version of the post
7. A live editing animation begins, showing characters being backspaced and typed to transform the original text into the edited version
8. Once the animation completes, the edited post replaces the current post in the generatedPosts array and is added to edit history
9. The UI displays the fully edited post
10. User can undo to previous versions by clicking the undo button or redo previously undone changes with the redo button

### Post Saving Flow

1. User clicks "Save to Dashboard" button, triggering handleSavePost
2. handleSavePost calls the onSavePost callback function with the current post
3. The Dashboard component adds the post to its displayPosts array
4. The post appears in the Dashboard UI with scheduled status

## AI Edit Feature

The AI Edit feature allows users to modify post content through natural language instructions, leveraging AI to transform and improve posts based on user guidance.

### Feature Overview

1. **Purpose and Functionality**
   - Enables users to edit posts using natural language instructions (e.g., "Make more professional," "Add emojis")
   - Maintains the core message while applying stylistic and tonal changes
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for AI-powered content refinement
   - Visualizes edits through animated transitions to show changes

2. **User Experience Flow**

     call OpenAI API -> 
     receive edited content -> 
     animate transition -> 
     update post in state -> 
     add to edit history
   ```

4. **Animation Implementation**
   - The `animateTextChange()` function visualizes the transformation:
     - Supports two animation types:
       1. Word-level animation (with detailed diff information): Shows specific words being added/removed
       2. Character-by-character animation (with basic diff): Shows backspacing and typing effects
     - Uses setTimeout for staged animation effects
     - Implements blinking cursor visual for realistic typing effect
     - Supports manual handling of newlines and text positioning

5. **API Integration**
   - Calls to `/api/openai` endpoint with:
     - `postContent`: Original post text
     - `editInstruction`: User's editing instruction
     - `modelPreference`: Speed vs. quality setting
   - API returns:
     - `editedPost`: Transformed content
     - `diff`: Optional detailed change information to enhance animation

6. **Version History Integration**
   - Adds each AI edit as a new version in the post history
   - Enables undo/redo functionality to navigate between versions
   - Animations play when reverting to previous versions or redoing changes

7. **Model Preferences**
   - "Fastest": Prioritizes speed over quality for quick edits
   - "Balanced": Moderate processing time with good quality results
   - "Quality": Prioritizes edit quality with longer processing time

   - `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` library.
   - `createClientComponentClient` used within `SupabaseProvider` to create a shared client instance.
   - SupabaseProvider for auth state management via React Context (`useSupabase` hook provides context value).
   - Login/Signup/Dashboard pages use the `useSupabase` hook to access the shared client and auth state.

2. **Server-Side Protection (Middleware)**
   - `middleware.ts` uses `createMiddlewareClient` from `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`.
   - Middleware verification of sessions via cookies.
   - Automatic **rewrite** to `/login` for unauthorized access to `/dashboard`.
   - Automatic **redirect** from `/login`/`/signup` to `/dashboard` if user is already authenticated.

3. **Database Security**
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Secure triggers for user profile creation
   - Foreign key relationships between auth and public schemas

## LinkedIn Post Storage

The LinkedIn Post Storage system enables the persistent storage of generated LinkedIn posts in Supabase, associating them with user accounts and allowing retrieval when users load their dashboard.

### Feature Overview

1. **Data Persistence**
   - Posts are saved to the Supabase `linkedin_posts` table
   - Each post is associated with the user who created it via a foreign key
   - Posts can be retrieved when a user logs in and loads their dashboard
   - Status tracking allows visibility into scheduled, posted, and failed posts

2. **Database Schema**
   - Table: `linkedin_posts`
     - `id`: UUID (primary key, auto-generated)
     - `user_id`: UUID (foreign key to auth.users)
     - `title`: Text (post title or article title)
     - `content`: Text (actual post content)
     - `image_url`: Text (optional, for any images in the post)
     - `scheduled_date`: Date (when the post is scheduled to be published)
     - `scheduled_time`: Time (time of day for scheduled posts)
     - `status`: Enum ('scheduled', 'posted', 'failed')
     - `engagement`: JSONB (stores metrics like likes, comments, shares)
     - `created_at`: Timestamp (when the post was created)
     - `updated_at`: Timestamp (when the post was last updated)

3. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Policies ensure users can only:
     - Read their own posts: `SELECT` policy using `auth.uid() = user_id`
     - Create posts for themselves: `INSERT` policy with check `auth.uid() = user_id`
     - Update only their own posts: `UPDATE` policy using `auth.uid() = user_id`
     - Delete only their own posts: `DELETE` policy using `auth.uid() = user_id`
   - Index on `user_id` column for improved query performance
   - Automatic `updated_at` timestamp management through a trigger

4. **User Flow**
   - User generates posts using the PostGenerator component
   - User selects and saves a post to their dashboard
   - The post is stored in Supabase with scheduled/draft status
   - When the dashboard loads, all of the user's posts are retrieved and displayed

### Technical Implementation

1. **Save Post Process**
   - When a user clicks "Post" button, the `handleSaveCurrentPost` method is called
   - The method prepares post data with:
     - Title and content from the editor
     - Current date/time for scheduling information
     - Initial 'scheduled' status
     - Optional image URL if available
   - Post data is sent to the server via `/api/posts` endpoint
   - The endpoint inserts the post into the `linkedin_posts` table with the user's ID
   - On successful save:
     - New post is added to the display posts list for immediate visibility
     - Success notification appears briefly to confirm the save
     - Editor is cleared or reset for new content
   - On failure:
     - Error message is displayed
     - User can retry the save operation

2. **Fetch Posts Process**
   - When the Dashboard component mounts, it fetches the user's posts
   - A Supabase query filters posts by the current user's ID
   - Posts are sorted by created date (newest first)
   - The posts are displayed in the appropriate tabs based on status

3. **API Integration**
   - Server endpoints for CRUD operations:
     - `POST /api/posts` - Create a new post
     - `GET /api/posts` - Retrieve all posts for the current user
     - `PATCH /api/posts/:id` - Update an existing post
     - `DELETE /api/posts/:id` - Delete a post

4. **Optimistic UI Updates**
   - When saving a post, it's immediately added to the UI
   - If the save fails, the UI is updated to reflect the error state
   - This provides immediate feedback while the backend processes the request

### Edge Cases and Error Handling

1. **Network Failures**
   - Temporary storage of posts if save fails due to network issues
   - Retry mechanism for failed saves
   - Appropriate error messaging to users

2. **Data Validation**
   - Server-side validation of post content and metadata
   - Enforcement of maximum post length limits
   - Prevention of duplicate posts within short time frames

3. **Sync Issues**
   - Handling of concurrent edits from multiple devices
   - Timestamp-based conflict resolution
   - Last-write-wins strategy for updates

### Future Enhancements

1. **Planned Improvements**
   - Batch operations for multiple posts
   - Scheduled publishing via automation
   - Historical engagement tracking
   - Advanced analytics on post performance

2. **Integration Opportunities**
   - Direct publishing to LinkedIn via API integration
   - AI-powered recommendations for optimal posting times
   - Content calendar visualization and management
   - Cross-platform social media posting
