# LinkedIn Post Generator System Design

## System Overview

The LinkedIn Post Generator is a feature within the LinkedIn Automation Platform that allows users to generate, edit, and schedule LinkedIn posts based on article links and topics. The system streamlines the content creation process by automatically generating post variations that users can customize.

## Authentication and User Management

The system integrates with Supabase for secure user authentication and data storage:

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - **Sign Up**: Multi-step form collecting account, company, and goal information
   - **Sign In**: Email/password authentication with session management
     - Utilizes `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` client-side for `signInWithPassword`.
     - Client-side authentication state is managed via `SupabaseProvider` context.
   - **Password Reset**: Secure password recovery flow
   - **Session Management**: Handled via cookies set by `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`.
   - **Route Protection**: Middleware checks session cookies and manages access to protected routes.

2. **Security Measures**
   - Server-side session validation via middleware using `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` (`createMiddlewareClient`).
   - Password hashing and security managed by Supabase Auth
   - Protected API routes with RLS (Row Level Security)
   - CSRF protection handled implicitly by Supabase Auth Helpers cookie mechanism (verify this if critical).

3. **User Profiles**
   - Core user data stored in auth.users table
   - Extended profile information in public.user_profiles table
   - Goal tracking and preference management (as per user profile schema)
   - Company and website information storage

4. **Database Schema for Authentication**
   - **auth.users**: Core authentication information (managed by Supabase)
   - **public.user_profiles**: Extended user information
     - full_name: User's full name
     - company_name: User's company
     - website: Company website
     - goals: Array of selected marketing goals

## Component Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Dashboard (src/app/dashboard/page.tsx)**
   - Main application interface
   - Displays scheduled and posted content
   - Contains developer controls and feature toggles
   - Uses `useSupabase` hook for auth state and `signOut`.
   - Includes client-side check to redirect unauthenticated users.
   - Integrates with the PostGenerator component

2. **PostGenerator (src/components/PostGenerator.tsx)**
   - Form for industry, topic selection, article selection, and post generation triggering.
   - Displays generated post variations
   - Provides navigation, editing (manual & AI), and version history for posts.
   - Allows saving posts to the dashboard via `onSavePost` prop.

3. **Authentication Components**
   - **Login (src/app/login/page.tsx)**: User authentication
     - Uses `useSupabase` hook to access context-provided client for login actions.
   - **Signup (src/app/signup/page.tsx)**: New user registration
   - **ResetPassword (src/app/reset-password/page.tsx)**: Password recovery
   - **SupabaseProvider (src/components/providers/supabase-provider.tsx)**: Authentication state management
     - Creates single client instance (`createClientComponentClient`) and provides it via context.
     - Provides `user`, `session`, `isLoading`, `signOut`, and the `supabase` client instance.
     - Handles `onAuthStateChange` events.

4. **UI Components**
   - ChevronIcons (src/components/icons/ChevronIcons.tsx): Navigation arrows for post cycling
   - Future components: Modal dialogs, Toast notifications, etc.

### Data Models

1. **Post**
   - id: string
   - title: string
   - content: string
   - imageUrl?: string
   - scheduledDate: string
   - scheduledTime: string
   - status: 'scheduled' | 'posted' | 'failed'
   - engagement?: { likes: number, comments: number, shares: number }

2. **Topic**
   - id: string
   - label: string

3. **UserProfile (public.user_profiles)**
   - id: uuid (from auth.users)
   - email: string
   - full_name: string
   - company_name: string
   - website: string
   - goals: string[]
   - created_at: timestamp
   - updated_at: timestamp

### State Management

1. **Authentication State**
   - Managed by `SupabaseProvider` using React Context.
   - User session information
   - Login status tracking
   - User profile data access

2. **Dashboard State**
   - activeTab: Controls which tab is currently visible
   - postingStates: Tracks the posting status of individual posts
   - showScheduleButtons: Toggles visibility of scheduling features

3. **PostGenerator State (Managed within the component)**
   - Form State: articleLink, selectedTopic, customTopic, isCustomTopic, isGenerating
   - Generated Posts State: generatedPosts, currentPostIndex, editedPost, isEditing
   - Version History State: postHistory, currentPostHistory
   - AI Editor State: aiEditText, isAiEditOpen, isAnimatingEdit, animatedText, placeholderIndex

## Data Flow and Method Interactions

### Authentication Flow

1. **Sign Up Process**
   - User submits multi-step form with account, company, and goal information
   - Supabase Auth creates user in auth.users
   - Database trigger creates entry in public.user_profiles
   - User receives confirmation email
   - Upon confirmation, user can log in

2. **Sign In Process**
   - User submits credentials on Login page.
   - `handleLogin` uses `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword` from `useSupabase` hook.
   - `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` handles setting session cookies upon successful login.
   - `SupabaseProvider` detects `SIGNED_IN` event via `onAuthStateChange` and updates context.
   - Client-side navigation (e.g., `router.push('/home')`) occurs.

3. **Protected Route Access**
   - User navigates to `/dashboard`.
   - `middleware.ts` intercepts the request.
   - Middleware uses `createMiddlewareClient` to check for session cookies.
   - If no session cookie, middleware **rewrites** the response to serve the `/login` page content (URL remains `/dashboard`).
   - If session cookie exists, middleware allows the request to proceed.
   - `Dashboard` component renders, uses `useSupabase` hook to get auth state.
   - If `user` is null after loading, it performs a client-side redirect to `/login` (redundant safety check).

### Post Generation Flow

1. User enters an article link and selects a topic in the PostGenerator component
2. User clicks "Generate Posts" button, triggering the handleGeneratePosts method
3. handleGeneratePosts makes an API call (simulated in current implementation)
4. Generated posts are stored in the generatedPosts state array
5. First post is automatically selected (currentPostIndex = 0)

### Post Navigation Flow

1. User clicks navigation arrows to cycle through posts
2. handlePreviousPost and handleNextPost methods update currentPostIndex
3. useEffect hook updates editedPost when currentPostIndex changes (if not in editing mode)
4. UI displays the post at the current index

### Post Editing Flow

1. User clicks the edit button on a post, triggering handleStartEditing
2. isEditing state is set to true, displaying the editing interface
3. User edits the post content in the textarea
4. User can save changes (handleSaveEdit) or cancel (handleCancelEdit)
5. If saved, the post at the current index in generatedPosts is updated and added to the edit history
6. User can undo changes by clicking the undo button, which reverts to the previous version from history
7. User can redo changes by clicking the redo button, which applies a previously undone edit

### AI Post Editing Flow

1. User clicks the AI edit lightning bolt icon in the post header
2. An animated panel slides open within the post container
3. User enters an edit instruction in the AI Edit text field
4. User clicks the AI edit button, triggering the handleAiEdit method
5. handleAiEdit makes an API call to OpenAI with the current post text and edit instruction
6. The API returns an edited version of the post
7. A live editing animation begins, showing characters being backspaced and typed to transform the original text into the edited version
8. Once the animation completes, the edited post replaces the current post in the generatedPosts array and is added to edit history
9. The UI displays the fully edited post
10. User can undo to previous versions by clicking the undo button or redo previously undone changes with the redo button

### Post Saving Flow

1. User clicks "Save to Dashboard" button, triggering handleSavePost
2. handleSavePost calls the onSavePost callback function with the current post
3. The Dashboard component adds the post to its displayPosts array
4. The post appears in the Dashboard UI with scheduled status

## Future Enhancements

   - Social login integration (Google, LinkedIn)
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Organization/team management
   - Role-based access control

2. **API Integration**
   - Replace sample data with real API calls
   - Implement authenticated endpoints for post generation and scheduling

3. **User Preferences**

   - Personalize post generation based on user history

4. **Analytics Integration**
   - Track post performance metrics
   - Provide insights on optimal posting times and topics

5. **Advanced Editing**
   - AI-powered editing feature for post enhancement (implemented)
   - Hashtag recommendations based on topic and content
   - Image generation for posts

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Implementation

The authentication system uses Supabase Auth with the following components:

1. **Client-Side Integration**
   - `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` library.
   - `createClientComponentClient` used within `SupabaseProvider` to create a shared client instance.
   - SupabaseProvider for auth state management via React Context (`useSupabase` hook provides context value).
   - Login/Signup/Dashboard pages use the `useSupabase` hook to access the shared client and auth state.

2. **Server-Side Protection (Middleware)**
   - `middleware.ts` uses `createMiddlewareClient` from `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`.
   - Middleware verification of sessions via cookies.
   - Automatic **rewrite** to `/login` for unauthorized access to `/dashboard`.
   - Automatic **redirect** from `/login`/`/signup` to `/dashboard` if user is already authenticated.

3. **Database Security**
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Secure triggers for user profile creation
   - Foreign key relationships between auth and public schemas

### PostGenerator Component

The PostGenerator component is the core feature for generating LinkedIn posts. It provides:

1. **Input Form**
   - Article link input field
   - Topic selection dropdown with trending topics
   - Option to enter a custom topic

2. **Post Generation**
   - Sends article link and topic to backend
   - Displays loading state during generation
   - Shows generated posts once available

3. **Post Navigation**
   - Left/right arrows to cycle through post variations
   - Current post counter (e.g., "1/4")

4. **Post Editing**
   - In-place editing of generated posts
   - Save/cancel options for edits
   - Version history tracking for each post
   - Undo/redo buttons to navigate through edit history with animated transitions
