# LinkedIn Post Generator System Design

## System Overview

The LinkedIn Post Generator is a feature within the LinkedIn Automation Platform that allows users to generate, edit, and schedule LinkedIn posts based on article links and topics. The system streamlines the content creation process by automatically generating post variations that users can customize.

## Authentication and User Management

The system integrates with Supabase for secure user authentication and data storage:

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - **Sign Up**: Multi-step form collecting account, company, and goal information
   - **Sign In**: Email/password authentication with session management
   - **Password Reset**: Secure password recovery flow
   - **Session Management**: Middleware protection for authenticated routes

2. **Security Measures**
   - Server-side session validation via middleware
   - Password hashing and security managed by Supabase Auth
   - Protected API routes with RLS (Row Level Security)
   - CSRF protection built into authentication flow

3. **User Profiles**
   - Core user data stored in auth.users table
   - Extended profile information in public.user_profiles table
   - Goal tracking and preference management
   - Company and website information storage

4. **Database Schema for Authentication**
   - **auth.users**: Core authentication information (managed by Supabase)
   - **public.user_profiles**: Extended user information
     - full_name: User's full name
     - company_name: User's company
     - website: Company website
     - goals: Array of selected marketing goals

## Data Flow and Method Interactions

### Authentication Flow

1. **Sign Up Process**
   - User submits multi-step form with account, company, and goal information
   - Supabase Auth creates user in auth.users
   - Database trigger creates entry in public.user_profiles
   - User receives confirmation email
   - Upon confirmation, user can log in

2. **Sign In Process**
   - User submits credentials
   - Supabase Auth validates and creates session
   - Middleware checks for valid session on protected routes
   - SupabaseProvider makes user data available throughout the app

3. **Protected Route Access**
   - Middleware checks for valid session
   - Redirects unauthenticated users to login
   - Redirects authenticated users away from auth pages

### Post Generation Flow

1. User enters an article link and selects a topic in the PostGenerator component
2. User clicks "Generate Posts" button, triggering the handleGeneratePosts method
3. handleGeneratePosts makes an API call (simulated in current implementation)
4. Generated posts are stored in the generatedPosts state array
5. First post is automatically selected (currentPostIndex = 0)

### Post Navigation Flow

1. User clicks navigation arrows to cycle through posts
2. handlePreviousPost and handleNextPost methods update currentPostIndex
3. useEffect hook updates editedPost when currentPostIndex changes (if not in editing mode)
4. UI displays the post at the current index

### Post Editing Flow

1. User clicks the edit button on a post, triggering handleStartEditing
2. isEditing state is set to true, displaying the editing interface
3. User edits the post content in the textarea
4. User can save changes (handleSaveEdit) or cancel (handleCancelEdit)
5. If saved, the post at the current index in generatedPosts is updated and added to the edit history
6. User can undo changes by clicking the undo button, which reverts to the previous version from history
7. User can redo changes by clicking the redo button, which applies a previously undone edit

### AI Post Editing Flow

1. User clicks the AI edit lightning bolt icon in the post header
2. An animated panel slides open within the post container
3. User enters an edit instruction in the AI Edit text field
4. User clicks the AI edit button, triggering the handleAiEdit method
5. handleAiEdit makes an API call to OpenAI with the current post text and edit instruction
6. The API returns an edited version of the post
7. A live editing animation begins, showing characters being backspaced and typed to transform the original text into the edited version
8. Once the animation completes, the edited post replaces the current post in the generatedPosts array and is added to edit history
9. The UI displays the fully edited post
10. User can undo to previous versions by clicking the undo button or redo previously undone changes with the redo button

### Post Saving Flow

1. User clicks "Save to Dashboard" button, triggering handleSavePost
2. handleSavePost calls the onSavePost callback function with the current post
3. The Dashboard component adds the post to its displayPosts array
4. The post appears in the Dashboard UI with scheduled status

## Future Enhancements
